		<h3>2024-01-01</h3>

		<p>have started this writing a couple of times since november when we bought the house.  i always struggle with how public or private to make it.  i want to publish something, but i don't want to make my private life public.  i guess i want this to be the presentation.  maybe like a log.  if you're reading you should think of it as somewhat performative because i'm trying to create a document.</p>

		<p>since it is new year's day, it is a good time to reflect.  one time in my twenties i thought i had health problems and it prompted me to think about my perfect day.  i also happened to get a book around that time called 'daily rituals' that outlined routines of well known historical figures.  so i thought about my perfect day.  at that time i was interested in being a painter.  i forget what my imagined day was like, but i think the outcome of this thinking was that i started going to the art student's league in new york.</p>

		<p>i was super scared to go in there because i had been mostly pushing paint around a canvas in my room and didn't have any social credentials.  (i can see that i am already writing about my personal life.  as a chronic oversharer i am not surprised.)  anyway, that was a life changing experience and i painted very seriously for about ten years.</p>

		<p>so in line with that i can start the exercise for 2024 and then maybe set some goals just to get aligned.  this is not some kind of fantasy, i am mostly doing what i want.  i have to work, and things like that.  but i have to get aligned so time doesn't slip away.</p>

		<p>my responsibility is work.  i start early.  this year i want to get the garden going.  i want to learn about plants and landscaping and really put a lot of work into my garden.  so i think a little break from my work to walk the garden is in line.  i usually start work at 6am, then have breakfast around 8am and run an 8:30-9am meeting.  sometime before 10am i need to walk the garden and see how things are going.  one of my goals is to take weekly garden pictures, so this might be a good time.</p>

		<p>over my lunch hour i run.  i have to get in the routine of going 5 days a week.  i might run on the weekends, i am not sure.  but i need to do whatever it takes to run 5 days a week.  i need to get out the door.  i need to be healthy enough to get out the door and run, even if it is only a couple miles.  i would like to have a nice 8-10 miler in there once a week.  that is my stretch goal.  if i had a 10 mile long run once a week i could easily be decent at 10k.  so let's see if i can do that.</p>

		<p>stretching, strength and recovery have to go into the routine.  i am already doing this, but need to make sure i am getting it done.  slant box stretching, foam roller, lacrosse ball rolling, and resistance bands for both hips and shoulders.</p>

		<p>after my run i eat lunch and finish up work.  then it's on.  i've got three things to do: work on the garden, paint, and do home improvement.  i would say the frequency needs to be 5/3/2.  garden every day, paint three times a week, and do home improvement twice a week.  we need to get a lot done in the house and i have to chip away at it and keep projects going.</p>

		<p>i do want to paint at least 10 pictures this year.  i'm thinking about a stack sitting up against the wall next time this year and what would make me feel like i'm a painter again.  it will come.  i need to get started this week by making a canvas.  get a woodworking station set up in the garage and make a stretcher.  i have to work on this all at the same time.</p>

		<p>for the house, top priority is the floors.  then i need to replace the dishwasher, bathroom fan, and garbage disposal.  my wife is lead on the bedroom we are re-doing.  we need to put trim on and paint and things like that.  i will help her out and work on that.  but my main priority is the floors.  i have to rebuild the entryway floor and then install hardwood in the main room, hallway, and entryway.  after that i can start thinking about other rooms.</p>

		<p>gardening is just going to happen.</p>

		<p>i guess other than that during the week it's all about sleep and eating well.  i usuall do pretty good here.  one of the main reasons i wanted a house was to bring all my projects to one place.  that's why this log is called 'urbana home'.  its my urbana home studio.  no more riding my bike to the studio to paint.  i can paint landscape in my yard.  i can do my woodworking.  all of this saves time and effort so i can get my sleep and focus on work.</p>

		<p>now for the weekends everything is mostly the same:  painting, running, gardening, home projects.  but i also want to travel.  i am interested in the illinois landscape.  we just got back from california, and the landscape is wonderful and amazing; but i kept thinking -- i don't want to grow those trees, i don't want to paint these landscapes.  i want to dig deep on the place where i grew up and the place i know.  i want to know it more and share my sensibilities that i developed here in my art.  of course now everything has been influenced by being away.  but i know things about this place in an abstract sense-- everybody has this for the place they grew up.</p>

		<p>anyway, i want to visit natural history interests, gardens, parks, woods, etc. throughout illinois.  i want to take my wife around to see all of these places.  hopefully i will write and share pictures.</p>

		<p>i am hoping to write at least once a week, and like i said before, i want to take garden pictures once a week.</p>

	<h3>2024-01-06</h3>

		<p>writing on a saturday now.  i had been anxious about getting compost delivered since we moved in, but we went up to the landscape recycling center and scheduled a delivery.  it came on thursday.  four cubic yards.</p>


		<div class="image-container" aria-live="polite">

	    </div>

	    <p>before it came i rushed to get a compost bin built.  i can't even remember why now, because i am not going to put the compost in the compost bin.  i am building vegetable gardens.</p>

		<div class="image-container" aria-live="polite">
	        <img src='./images/IMG_4452.jpg'></img>
	    </div>

	    <p>nothing's ever going to be perfect.  we don't really have it all together but we need to get it going.  i had been reading about a couple of methods, and all of the sudden we were laying out cardboard.  is it the best way?  maybe not.</p>

	    <p>this is how we bought the house.  we were looking and then we were buying.  same thing with the garden beds.  i had been gathering information.  then i got the compost delivery, and realized its not really organic.  but it is local from the landscape recycling center.  which is kind of cool, i think.  i hope they didn't hose it down with poisons.  but i doubt they did-- i think somebody in this town would care to ask.  first thing my neighbor asked when he saw me loading wheelbarrows was if i was going to practice organic.  we are.  i would rather let pests take over and have everything die than spray my food with poison.</p>

	    <p>but i wasn't going to go up to a box store and buy a bunch of plastic wrapped bags of organic compost.  i guess that would be my other option?  or some kind of delivery.</p>

	    <p>also i'm not sure i love doing the cardboard underlayment.  we are laying into grass, and it seemed to be a good combination for the compost.  the best way is to probably lay a thick layer of wood mulch down, kill the grass, then remove the mulch and lay down compost.  but that's another delivery, and more time, and i would have to put the mulch somewhere.</p>

	    <p>if you read about cardboard, some people say it smothers the soil.  other people are saying it might have the forever chemicals.  we removed all the tape and used brown boxes with as little print as possible.  we are doing alright.  and hopefully we will have home grown vegetables in the summer.</p>

		<div class="image-container" aria-live="polite">
	        <img src='./images/IMG_4447.jpg'></img>
	    </div>

	    <p>i worked pretty hard for a couple afternoons and a lunch getting that set up.  there is not much daylight so you are done before five.  we got the first bed laid out and there is still a huge pile of compost.  so we are going to do another one of the same size, and then maybe more.  i need to do some grading around the house and add some over the trees i planted before christmas.</p>

	    <p>i was all set to work this weekend but it snowed last night.  something that was not in the forecast when i ordered the compost on wednesday night.  so now it will be a couple of days before i can work again.  that gives me a good chance to actually get my seeds ordered.</p>

		<p>my wife and i were looking at vegetable seeds last night.  she is the cook so i want to grow those for her.  i'm excited about eating cucumbers and hopefully i can grow some muskmelons.</p>

		<p>i am going to do most of the perennial plantings.  again i have been reading for months, and now its time to see what actually happens when it happens.</p>
		

		
	<h3>2024-01-07</h3>

		<p>recap writing is boring.  its always better to write when trying to figure something out.  the ideas are coming out fresh because it is being made up rather than recalled.  for me now, i am trying to figure out what to do with the garden.  it is my goal to make pretty much the entire property a garden.  or rather, i would like to be actively cultivating something everywhere.  we inherited some stones that make a fire ring, and i'd like to have grass around that.  paths are getting mucky and worn down already so i'm not sure what will happen there.</p>

		<p>any way i've got almost the entire front lawn to plant.  we are on about a quarter acre.  the front lawn is on the north side, but our house is a small ranch so it gets almost complete sun.  there are two dogwoods-- one at each corner of the house, and a serviceberry trained to a single trunk towards the front of the yard.</p>


		<p>i have been working almost exclusively on the back yard.  the first surprise i got as a new homeowner is that the hemlock tree on the very back corner of the property was freshly broken and hanging above the drop line to my house. so i had a tree guy come out and take that one but also thin some other poorly planted trees along the property line.  i had them take two spruces, a red bud, and an eastern white pine.</p>

		<p>it sounds like a lot, and it was, but i still have a lot of trees back there.  whoever had this property a while back was interested in plants, but i have to question their placement.  the red bud had grown over the top of a spruce, and was blocking yet another spruce causing it to lean.  how do i describe.  it was kind of a mess back there.  but we have a row of hemlocks in the neighbor's yard backing up about 5/8 of the property.  i have one maybe 35 foot spruce, a 40 foot maple, a bay magnolia, a crab apple of some sort that is about 20-25 feet and mature, and many red bud volunteers around 5 years old.  i'll get to describing all of the plants out there at some point.</p>

		<p>the tree that caused me a lot of anxiety was the white pine.  it was a 30 year old tree and maybe 40 feet high.  and they let it grow less than 10 feet from the power line.  so the power company had been hacking at it over the years and it was leaning back towards my yard and house.  it definitely could have stayed, but i cut it for those reasons and wanting to let some sun in for the vegetable garden.</p>

		<p>the problem is, this tree was majestic and set the tone for the whole backyard.  i am still sad when i think about it.  there is a giant hole there now, and it will take years if not decades to fill in with the level of character that tree provided.  ultimately i thought the tree was on borrowed time.  it was a tough decision and i lost sleep over it and worried that the neighbors hated me (i eventually asked both that could see the tree and they said it was a good decision).</p>

		<p>that was kind of my gardening debut, and to be honest i wasn't ready for that level of a decision.  but i made it and on we go.  since then i have planted a multi stem serviceberry and three tall and narrow arborvitae along the fence line to block the direct line of sight between windows.</p>

		<p>i liked picking out those trees.  i would go out there, set out stakes for where i thought they would go, then come in and read endlessly on the internet trying to find the right tree that i could reasonably source.  it was a contemplative process like setting up a still life painting.  (that is what i am doing after all).</p>

		<p>so now i have to do more plantings, but i don't like the pace.  i want to plant the whole yard, but i don't have a big enough awareness to get my pallete right.  i can't think of spatial relationships sitting in here on the computer.</p>

		<p>and i know i can design step by step, but this kind of design requires a greater level of patience than anything i have done.  i was reading that leadplant can take three years to properly get going.  but if i go plant the whole yard this year, i'm probably only going to learn that i don't want to do that.  i want the experience in design.  i want to fit everything together based off what is there.</p>

		<p>so i guess i got my answer.  i am going to focus on the back yard.  i know i want to establish a thicket for birds under the hemlocks, and am thinking chokecherry and ninebark.  i want to get some shade tolerant plants on the shade side of those and under the mature crab apple.  i can work on my stratification technique and get some experience there.  and there are also plants back there that i haven't seen in bloom or identified.</p>

		<p>i can watch the front garden that is planted right up against the house.  do a pruning on the serviceberry, and start visiting gardens and paying attention to textures, colors, form, and bloom time.  i think the garden will be better for it.  i am still in a hurry, but need to find the right pace.</p>
