		<p>this is an evolving document.  i am keeping everything on github so there is a changelog.  i wanted to write about the house and i started writing about the buying process and the beginnings of home ownership--  but i don't want this to be a handyman tutorial or home buyer how-to.  i learned a lot.  the best thing i did was buy a house that was well under the top of my budget.  i'm living in a two bedroom house in a midwestern college town and feeling grateful.</p>

		<p>we worked with good people for the transaction, but it became obvious that everyone except the buyer is incentivized to speed through every checkpoint and get to the pay day.  worries get smoothed over and issues are normalized.  its hard to know what is in proper shape and what is not, even after the inspection.  other than coming in lower than max budget, i recommend to not negotiate for repairs done by the seller.  either get a credit or lower the price.  only one of my four repairs was done properly, and i am making corrections now.</p>

		<p>i do want to keep a list of projects, but i'm not going to write about how to fix a leaky sink faucet handle.  i want to write about design, not repairs.  the first thing is flooring.  we took out carpet in the living room and hallway and tile in the entryway.  carpet is a smelly and disgusting health hazard although it is cozy.  we had to remove the tile in the entry because the subfloor is warped and the room had a crown.  i think we will put wood in all those spaces.</p>

		<p>i want the house to be nice, but i am most excited about the outdoor space.  things move slowly.  first line of order is cutting down a tree that broke, and some others that are too close to the power line.  i feel bad about cutting down trees, but they have not been managed properly for a small yard with overhead power lines.  i want to open up the backyard for sun and that is the deciding factor.</p>
