		<p>We bought the house on the third.  Three days before our anniversary.  We got restless when we came back from Thailand.  We lived in a good place in Chicago but it wasn't our place.  Actually the secret that nobody knows is that we were expecting a child.  I had forgotten about that.  It all changed so fast and then we were moving and I forgot.  Now we need things done.  There is no hurry but there is a lot to do.</p>

		<p>First is air quality.  I crawled the crawl space and replaced the furnace filter.  We thought about making the carpet clean enough to live with while we decided what to replace it with, but yesterday we tore it out.  It smelled like chemical makeup and pets and had dust and mold underneath.</p>

		<p>Today I removed the rest of the tile in the entry way.  The tile was fine, but there was a crown in the floor and the closet door was sticking.  I chiseled the tile out and found an old school mortar bed around two inches thick.  If you're using a chisel and a hammer get a heavy hammer-- the heaviest hammer you can swing.  It's loud and back breaking work.  I guess you can build up your back to get used to kneeling over like that.</p>

		<p>Tomorrow I will keep working and I will remove the mortar bed down to the subfloor to see if I can figure out why there was a crown.  The electrician is coming in two days.</p>
