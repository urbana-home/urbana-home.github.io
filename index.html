		<p>We bought the house on the third.  Three days before our anniversary.  We got restless when we came back from Thailand.  We lived in a good place in Chicago but it wasn't our place.  Actually the secret that nobody knows is that we were expecting a child.  I had forgotten about that.  It all changed so fast and then we were moving and I forgot.  Now we need things done.  There is no hurry but there is a lot to do.</p>

		<p>First is air quality.  I crawled the crawl space and replaced the furnace filter.  We thought about making the carpet clean enough to live with while we decided what to replace it with, but yesterday we tore it out.  It smelled like chemical makeup and pets and had dust and mold underneath.</p>
