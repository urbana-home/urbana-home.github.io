		<p>We bought the house on the third.  Three days before our anniversary.  We got restless when we came back from Thailand.  I'm always thinking about where and how I want to live.  We lived in a good place in Chicago but it wasn't our place.  I wanted to get out of there and then we were expecting a child and that made it easy to think about having a house.  I had forgotten about that.  It all changed so fast and then we were moving and I forgot.  Now there are things to do.  There is no hurry but there is a lot to do.</p>

		<p>First is air quality.  I crawled the crawl space and replaced the furnace filter.  We thought about making the carpet clean enough to live with while we decided what to replace it with, but yesterday we tore it out.  It smelled like chemical makeup and pets and had dust and mold underneath.  It's hard to think about installing carpet after ripping up an old one.</p>

		<p>The basic things are working in there.  We are getting an electrician in to install GFCI breakers in the panel so we can have three prong outlets.  The furnace seems to be working and the roof isn't showing any leaks.  The toilets flush and the water runs and the lights turn on.  We need to install new locks.</p>

		<p>The kitchen appliances are old but they work.  I guess there isn't really that much that we need to do, but we want to make it nice in there.  I am most excited about working on the yard.</p>

		<p>Today I removed the rest of the tile in the entry way.  The tile was fine, but there was a crown in the floor and the closet door was sticking.  I chiseled the tile out and found an old school mortar bed around two inches thick.  If you're using a chisel and a hammer get a heavy hammer-- the heaviest hammer you can swing.  It's loud and back breaking work.  I guess you can build up your back to get used to kneeling over like that.</p>

		<p>Tomorrow I will keep working and I will remove the mortar bed down to the subfloor to see if I can figure out why there was a crown.  The electrician is coming in two days.</p>

		<p>Today we raked leaves and I cut down all the pokeweed in the thicket in the back.  I put it all into heavy duty black garbage bags that we bought for renovations.  My plan is to make two compost bins in the back out of posts and chicken wire.  One I will do leaves only and the other will be a more regular compost pile.  I was reading about the leaf only 'leaf mold' online.  It's a long process and I don't have any tools to chop the leaves down and speed it up.  I want to do it because I like the idea of re-using the leaves that fall on my yard rather than carting them away.</p>

		<p>I also took out a spot of the mortar bed in the entry way down to the subfloor.  My friend came over and looked at the floors and we talked about different options.  The dining room and bedrooms have red oak flooring.  Everything else we will replace at some point.  We took out the carpet and tile and there is linoleum in the kitchen and bathroom.</p>
