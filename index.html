		<h3>2024-01-01</h3>

		<p>have started this writing a couple of times since november when we bought the house.  i always struggle with how public or private to make it.  i want to publish something, but i don't want to make my private life public.  i guess i want this to be the presentation.  maybe like a log.  if you're reading you should think of it as somewhat performative because i'm trying to create a document.</p>

		<p>since it is new year's day, it is a good time to reflect.  one time in my twenties i thought i had health problems and it prompted me to think about my perfect day.  i also happened to get a book around that time called 'daily rituals' that outlined routines of well known historical figures.  so i thought about my perfect day.  at that time i was interested in being a painter.  i forget what my imagined day was like, but i think the outcome of this thinking was that i started going to the art student's league in new york.</p>

		<p>i was super scared to go in there because i had been mostly pushing paint around a canvas in my room and didn't have any social credentials.  (i can see that i am already writing about my personal life.  as a chronic oversharer i am not surprised.)  anyway, that was a life changing experience and i painted very seriously for about ten years.</p>

		<p>so in line with that i can start the exercise for 2024 and then maybe set some goals just to get aligned.  this is not some kind of fantasy, i am mostly doing what i want.  i have to work, and things like that.  but i have to get aligned so time doesn't slip away.</p>

		<p>my responsibility is work.  i start early.  this year i want to get the garden going.  i want to learn about plants and landscaping and really put a lot of work into my garden.  so i think a little break from my work to walk the garden is in line.  i usually start work at 6am, then have breakfast around 8am and run an 8:30-9am meeting.  sometime before 10am i need to walk the garden and see how things are going.  one of my goals is to take weekly garden pictures, so this might be a good time.</p>

		<p>over my lunch hour i run.  i have to get in the routine of going 5 days a week.  i might run on the weekends, i am not sure.  but i need to do whatever it takes to run 5 days a week.  i need to get out the door.  i need to be healthy enough to get out the door and run, even if it is only a couple miles.  i would like to have a nice 8-10 miler in there once a week.  that is my stretch goal.  if i had a 10 mile long run once a week i could easily be decent at 10k.  so let's see if i can do that.</p>

		<p>stretching, strength and recovery have to go into the routine.  i am already doing this, but need to make sure i am getting it done.  slant box stretching, foam roller, lacrosse ball rolling, and resistance bands for both hips and shoulders.</p>

		<p>after my run i eat lunch and finish up work.  then it's on.  i've got three things to do: work on the garden, paint, and do home improvement.  i would say the frequency needs to be 5/3/2.  garden every day, paint three times a week, and do home improvement twice a week.  we need to get a lot done in the house and i have to chip away at it and keep projects going.</p>

		<p>i do want to paint at least 10 pictures this year.  i'm thinking about a stack sitting up against the wall next time this year and what would make me feel like i'm a painter again.  it will come.  i need to get started this week by making a canvas.  get a woodworking station set up in the garage and make a stretcher.  i have to work on this all at the same time.</p>

		<p>for the house, top priority is the floors.  then i need to replace the dishwasher, bathroom fan, and garbage disposal.  my wife is lead on the bedroom we are re-doing.  we need to put trim on and paint and things like that.  i will help her out and work on that.  but my main priority is the floors.  i have to rebuild the entryway floor and then install hardwood in the main room, hallway, and entryway.  after that i can start thinking about other rooms.</p>

		<p>gardening is just going to happen.</p>

		<p>i guess other than that during the week it's all about sleep and eating well.  i usuall do pretty good here.  one of the main reasons i wanted a house was to bring all my projects to one place.  that's why this log is called 'urbana home'.  its my urbana home studio.  no more riding my bike to the studio to paint.  i can paint landscape in my yard.  i can do my woodworking.  all of this saves time and effort so i can get my sleep and focus on work.</p>

		<p>now for the weekends everything is mostly the same:  painting, running, gardening, home projects.  but i also want to travel.  i am interested in the illinois landscape.  we just got back from california, and the landscape is wonderful and amazing; but i kept thinking -- i don't want to grow those trees, i don't want to paint these landscapes.  i want to dig deep on the place where i grew up and the place i know.  i want to know it more and share my sensibilities that i developed here in my art.  of course now everything has been influenced by being away.  but i know things about this place in an abstract sense-- everybody has this for the place they grew up.</p>

		<p>anyway, i want to visit natural history interests, gardens, parks, woods, etc. throughout illinois.  i want to take my wife around to see all of these places.  hopefully i will write and share pictures.</p>

		<p>i am hoping to write at least once a week, and like i said before, i want to take garden pictures once a week.</p>
