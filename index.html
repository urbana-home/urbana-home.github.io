		<p>projects are ongoing inside the house, but i am most interest in the outside space.  i put up several bird feeders a couple weeks ago when we moved in and we are starting to see birds.  lots of cardinals and house finches.  we also have sparrows and bluejays and i have seen both downy and yellow bellied woodpecker, but not on the feeders yet.</p>

		<p>yard work starts in earnest this friday.  the day after we got the keys the neighbor pointed out that a hemlock on the very southwest corner of the property was broken and in danger of falling on the power line.  i called a tree service to take care of it, but i also decided to thin some other trees on the south edge of the property.  as time wears on and i wait for them to show up, i feel increasingly guilty about cutting down trees.  if i thought it was wrong i wouldn't do it, so i am going to go through with it, but i still feel bad.</p>

		<p>the tree that makes me feel most guilty is an eastern white pine about 15 feet from the hemlock.  i would guess it is 40-50 feet tall.  the problem with this tree is that it is too close to the power lines.  over the years they have hacked the side closest to the main power line and now it has a significant lean towards the drop line to the house.  it is not a good looking tree although it appears healthy.  i could probably let it grow for another 5-10 years, but that seems like borrowed time.  the tipping point is that i want to plant a vegetable garden in the center of the lawn and this will open up some mid afternoon sun.  i think it is the right decision, but cutting down a 40-50 foot tree is not a light decision.</p>

		<p>i am also going to take down a 30 foot spruce that does not produce on the lower two thirds, and a red bud and spruce that are too close to each other, to the point of the red bud growing directly across the trunk of the spruce.  these two trees are also too close to another bigger spruce, which we are keeping.  they have caused the big spruce to lean a bit for light, so i want to open that up and get that tree set up properly for the future.</p>

		<p>that leaves us with the big spruce on the east central part of the back yard, the crab apple as the south central focus of the yard, and then a magnolia along the western border and a huge maple on the northwest corner of the back yard, almost too close to the corner of the garage.  right now we have a lot of volunteer mulberries, redbuds and silver maple.  i have selected one redbud and one mulberry that i will keep for the birds.  they like to perch on them as they stage for the feeder and the mulberry will be great for food.</p>

		<p>i am trying to figure out what some of the shrubs and bushes are back there.  i know there is an oak leaf hydrangea and maybe a sypraea of some kind.  looks like potentially a holly.  the back yard is going to be great.  the back third where most of the trees are now is covered in some kind of ground cover, probably lamium.  this area gets shade from the neighbor's hemlocks.  beyond those, the other neighbor has a huge oak tree which gives multiple levels for birds to work on.  i am going to set up more bushes and shrubs and shade tolerant perennials to attract birds.  i also want to plant a serviceberry to replace the white pine.</p>

		<p>on the west side where the too close spruce and red bud are, i will build my compost pile.  i have some posts and chicken wire that i well set up after the tree service comes.  then i can start on my other project of removing the rotting stump in the front yard that the neighbors seemed concerned about because it is close to their yard.  my plan is to break that up and put that at the bottom of my compost pile, and then have finished compost delivered so i can fill in the hole.  whatever is left over from the compost delivery will get spread out over gardens and used for some grading issues.
